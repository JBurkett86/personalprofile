					<h1>Personal Information</h1>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I grew up in North Queensland, finished high school and had a real passion for IT. After high school I started
						attending university and decided instead to get a job and start earning money. Landed an application support job
						with a software company in Brisbane that makes a CMR software that also does payroll and billing. </p>
				 <p>I love tinkering and playing around with technology, finding out how things work and trying to come up with
							ideas on how things can be improved or other applications of new tech. </p>

				 <p>In the last few years as a side project, I helped develop a wireless wind meter (anemometer) as a safety device
					 for the crane (construction) industry to measure wind speeds <a href="http://www.windblue.com.au/" target="_blank">www.windblue.com.au</a><br>
					 This device will constantly display the wind speed peaks from a wireless anemometer to a display unit and alert a crane
					 operator when a gust goes over the safe operating speeds. It lets them know from their cabin or operation location when they
					 need to stop or assess the current weather based on current safety standards. It comes with an Android and iPhone app
					 I developed so they can connect to the receiver unit with their phones and check wind speeds without being present
					 (i.e., if they are in wireless range, they can check without having to climb to the cabin).
					 <br>There’s so much potential and things to explore in IT.</p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Taking an idea and making it a reality, something you can use or hold, is such an attractive concept to me, then having someone
						 else getting value out of it or say “wow I love it” is just the icing on the cake. My lifelong interest and work in software and
						 electronics allows me to easily apply knowledge in these areas and enables me to take any idea and make it a reality. </p>
					<p>I especially enjoy the software development lifecycle, getting to talk to and know people from all different walks of life and professions.
						 I enjoy the experience of learning about what they do in their day-to-day jobs and being exposed to insights into how they operate in their industries.
						 Then identifying their needs and designing and building a solution that improves their daily lives gives me a great sense of accomplishment and fulfilment.</p>
					<p>My interest in IT started young, from my father’s interest and work in electronics as a telecommunications technician, seeing him pull
						apart to diagnose or repair an appliance inspired me that there is something more to these devices and we have control over how they work.
						I loved pulling apart anything and everything electronic from toys to home appliances, getting inside and seeing what made it work seemed
						almost magical to me. To keep me from pulling apart even working appliances, my parents bought me Dick Smith home electronic kits to build
						my own blinking light kits to an AM radio which started to give me the knowledge for how it all worked.</p>
					<p>My particular interest in how computers and software all worked started in high school, I had friends interested in building their own gaming computers,
						learning from them and in magazines about PC hardware, making it all work together and having control over how it all worked got me hooked.
						It was not long after that I was building my own Linux boxes for firewalls or internet caching, doing my own networking for LAN parties,
						writing software to prank my classmates and web development for making my own websites. The gratification with gaining knowledge in these
						areas of hardware and software systems kept me pursuing further and further for more knowledge and that hasn’t gone me to this day. </p>
					<p>I now work for a software company, LOOKUP Innovations, in Brisbane in their WorkDESK Software division, and I have been involved with this
						product for 15 years. <a href="http://www.workdesk.com.au/" target="_blank">www.workdesk.com.au</a> is the primary product which is a comprehensive
						end-to-end software solution for the Recruitment and Labour Hire industry in Australia. It is a single platform environment, specifically to
						meet the needs of the Recruitment and Labour Hire industry, from candidate management, rostering, job allocation to payroll and billing as a full financial package.<br>
						Since it is a small business my roles range from Application Support to Project Management and Software Developer. I get involved in any way
						I can for the complete end to end of the products development cycle. <br> When software improvements, taxation compliances or custom project
						from customers are required I use my skills to gather and document requirements
						(whether it be from customers or ATO Tax legislation changes), write project scopes, build project plans, estimate timelines, write software change
						specifications, write and execute testing scenarios, code software changes, review pull request from other developers, build and execute deployment plans. </p>
					<p>My most recent achievement was a major role in updating the payroll side of our software to be
						<a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Single-Touch-Payroll/Expanding-Single-Touch-Payroll-(Phase-2)/" target="_blank">Single Touch Payroll Phase 2</a>
						compliant with the ATO. This included requirement gathering from detailed ATO specification, project planning (Azure DevOps), task allocation to the
						project team, designing and maintaining Microsoft SQL databases, then coding C++ and C# software changes. As well as liaising with the ATO as a direct
						contact giving project updates and completing the ATO’s compliance reporting.<br>I also wrote user documentation and gave customers updates, including web presentations, to the changes as they were coming to help them transition and
					 education them on the new taxation reporting requirements. </p>

					<p>I’m now involved in a modernisation project of this software to a cloud-based web app product by using my knowledge from the existing product and
						helping update it to modern technologies. These roles include design specifications, documentation requirements and coding a .Net core app following
						Domain Driven Design and CQRS methodologies. Since this is a highly sort after product for our existing and ex customer base, I regularly provide
						road map updates via webinars when a new feature is finished or consultant with them if there are any features or ideas, they have that would improve the new product.</p>

					<p>I chose to study a Bachelor of Information technology at RMIT as it is rated high in the globally in World University Rankings, 1st in
						Graduate Employment Rate and high in a raking of the best universities that engage with employers. RMIT provides great resources for
						online studies that suits my needs while working fulltime. Through online studies I have more opportunities to be in direct contact with my peers,
						tutors and lecturers that would not be possible with a traditional on-site university while I am working full time. The lectures and tutors
						have a plethora of industry experience, they have a great passion for what they teach, are very approachable and eager for feedback on your
						learning resulting in a very connected environment. RMIT’s student services are great at reaching out and checking in with you as your online
						studies progress, since you don’t have an in-person presence. They are also great at providing you with resources, learning tools and strategies
						or even seeking your feedback to improve the learning environment. <br> At RMIT I expect to learn modern software development skills,
						improving my team management skills with peers and colleagues by working with other students.<p>

				<h1>Personality Profile</h1>
				<img src="Protagonist.png" alt="Protagonist">
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Personality Test - Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
					<p>Personality type: <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality?utm_source=welcome-assertive-protagonist&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=results&utm_content=type-personality-0" target="_blank"> Protagonist (ENFJ-A)</a></p>
					<h3>Strengths</h3>
					<p>Receptive – Protagonists have strong opinions, but they’re far from closed-minded. They recognize
						the importance of allowing others to express themselves fully. Even when Protagonists don’t agree
						with someone, they recognize that person’s right to voice their truth.</p>
					<p>Reliable – Few things bother Protagonists more than the prospect of letting down a person or cause
						that they believe in. People with this personality type can be counted on to see their promises and
						responsibilities through – even when it’s difficult to do so.</p>
					<p>Passionate – Protagonists are far from being boring do-gooders. These types brim with interests, and
						they take great pleasure in pursuing their hobbies – whether that’s hiking, cooking, dancing, growing
						houseplants, or something else entirely. As a result, they rarely find themselves at a loss for something interesting to do.</p>
					<p>Altruistic – These personalities are known for harboring a deep desire to be a force for positive
						change. Protagonists genuinely believe that if they bring people together, they can do a world of good.</p>
					<p>Charismatic – Determined and inspiring, Protagonists often find their way into leadership roles.
						Whether they’re captain of their softball team or a leader on the world stage, they rarely lose
						sight of their main goal: to be of service to others’ (NERIS Analytics Limited Protagonist (ENFJ) Strengths).</p>

					<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
					<p>Unrealistic – Many Protagonists put pressure on themselves to right every wrong that they encounter.
						But no matter how hard these personalities strive, it just isn’t realistic for them to solve all of
						the world’s problems. If they aren’t careful, they can spread themselves too thin – and be left unable to help anyone.</p>
					<p>Overly Idealistic – Protagonists tend to have clear ideas about what’s right and what’s wrong.
						They often think that everyone shares these fundamental principles – or, at least, that everyone
						should share these principles. So it can come as a genuine shock to Protagonists when people
						violate their core values, such as truth or justice.</p>
					<p>Condescending – People with this personality type enjoy teaching others, particularly about the
						causes and beliefs that matter so much to them. But, at times, Protagonists’ attempts to “enlighten”
						others may come across as patronizing – not the most effective strategy for persuading other people, unfortunately.</p>
					<p>Intense – When it comes to self-improvement, Protagonists are rarely short on energy or determination.
						But they may not recognize that not everyone shares these qualities. At times, Protagonists may push
						others to make changes that they aren’t ready for – or simply aren’t interested in making in the first place.</p>
					<p>Overly Empathetic – Compassion is among this personality type’s greatest strengths. But Protagonists
						have a tendency to take on other people’s problems as their own – a habit that can leave them emotionally
						and physically exhausted’ (NERIS Analytics Limited Protagonist (ENFJ) Weaknesses).</p>

					<h3>Team Building</h3>
					<p>I like to work and learn in social environments and discussions as well as a hands-on practical approach. <br>
						I enjoy discussing problems with my peers and hearing from others, getting their point of view on previous
						 experiences or things they’ve learnt. <br>
						An example of this is when I needed to learn C# for a project, although not to dissimilar to other languages
						I knew at the time, I took a few beginner and intermediate courses on PluraSight to fill my knowledge gap
						and get me up to date with the best practices. During and after completing the courses I would regularly
						consult with my colleagues on topics of specific interest or items that were difficult for me. I take this
						dialogue as feedback and reassurance that I am focusing on the correct areas and have a good understanding.
						Being able to explain and discuss verbally with peers that have more or similar experience also reinforces
						that I’m headed in the right direction. </p>

					<h3>Team Composition</h3>
					<p>My Protagonist (ENFJ-A) personality type gives me a role of leadership and guidance to build strong
						relationships and improve the lives of the team. I like to focus on people’s motivations and strengths.
						I like to discuss and have constant communication with my team and find out what really motivates them,
						what their goals are and how they can achieve their goals while being a benefit to the team. </p>
					<p>I can find peoples strengths quickly and designate tasks based on their specific strengths. Although
						some people don’t like always being designated in their strength areas and prefer to build up on other areas.
						I like to keep that as an option for people to express their goals and allow them to work in an area they
						might not be strong at, then link them to a person that is or find resources that can help.</p>

				<article>
					<h2>Learning Style Test</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">EMTRAIN Learning Style Quiz</p>
					<p><img src="LearningStyles.png" alt="Learning Styles"></p>
					<h3>Results</h3>
					<p>Pragmatists need to be able to see how to put the learning into practice in the real world.
						Abstract concepts and games are of limited use unless they can see a way to put the ideas into action.
						Pragmatists are likely to be experimenters, trying out new ideas, theories and techniques to see if they work.
						They may act quickly and confidently on ideas, getting straight to the point, and may lose patience with
						lengthy discussions.</p>
					<p>Learning methods especially suited to pragmatists include:
						<ul>
							<li>Practicals</li>
							<li>Case studies</li>
							<li>Problem setting</li>
							<li>Discussions</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Reflectors prefer to stand back and observe. They tend to be cautious, preferring to take a back seat.
						They like to collect and analyse information to help them reach their conclusions, which they may take
						considerable time and effort to develop. Reflectors see the big picture by using information gathered
						from previous experience as well as the here and now.</p>
						<p>Learning methods especially suited to reflectors include:
							<ul>
								<li>Paired discussions</li>
								<li>Self-analysis questionnaires</li>
								<li>Time out [simply build in sufficient breaks to make space for the reflectors]</li>
								<li>Showcase / Demonstrations</li>
								<li>Feedback from others</li>
								<li>Coaching</li><br>
							</ul>

					<h2>Learning Preferences</h2>
					<p>I like trying things out myself when learning a new design skill or planning methodology.
						I like to apply it to a project or piece of work I’ve done recently even if it is just writing it down on a piece of paper.
						This helps me piece together what I’ve learnt with a more relatable perspective and allows me to experiment or try out the idea quickly.
						Then relating that to some previous work helps me build ideas on how things could have been done better or worse and how I could apply this in future work.<br>
						Learning from online resources, from peer discussion and practically through experimenting gives me the ability to learn and apply things
						at a rapid pace by focusing on what is most relevant and up to date.</p>

					<h2>Personality Test</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Big Five Personality Test</p>
					<h3>Results</h3>
					<p><img src="BIG5-graphic.php.png" alt="Big Five Personality Results"></p>
					<p>Factor I 95% was labelled as Extroversion by the developers of the IPIP-BFFM. Factor I is sometimes given other names,
						such as Surgency or Positive Emotionality.</p>
					<p>Factor II 78% is labelled as Emotional Stability. Factor II is often referred to by other names, such as Neruoticism
						or Negative Emotionality (in these two cases interpretations are inverted, as Neruoticism and Negative Emotionality can
						be thought of as the opposite of Emotional Stability).</p>
					<p>Factor III 87% is labelled as Agreeableness. A person high in agreeableness is friendly and optimistic.
						Low scorers are critical and aggressive. <br>Individuals who score high on Factor I one are outgoing and social.
						Individuals who score low tend to be shut ins.</p>
					<p>Factor IV 62% is labelled as Conscientiousness. Individuals who score high on this factor are careful and diligent.
						Low scorers are impulsive and disorganized.</p>
					<p>Factor V 77% is labelled as Intellect/Imagination. This factor is also often called Openness to Experience.<br>
						People who score low tend to be traditional and conventional’ (Open-Source Psychometrics, Trait Descriptions).</p>

				<h3>Team Building</h3>
				<p>This gives me an advantage when creating a team as I like to find and focus on peoples’ strengths, and will give an
					overall benefit to the team.  I may initially come off as too idealistic or too pushy, but I like to take in all
					perspectives and open to new ideas. This lets the team know that I value their thoughts and opinions and that all ideas
					can be brought to the table. This also helps the team bond and lets other team members get a perspective of each other.<br>
					Overall, my leadership and people centred personality allows me to motivate the team, by focusing on their goals,
					giving positive reinforcement, building upon their strengths and a strong communication with the team.

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>FairPaid - How much do you think you should be paid? – A website that allows you to compare pay rates
						and entitlements for similar job roles in your location. </p>
					<p>This is a common question everyone has on their mind when taking on a new job or role and is also asked
						after so many years if your pay rate increases aren’t keeping up with inflation.<br>
					Some industries in Australia don’t have an award or enterprise agreement that gives a standardised pay rate
					and levels of pay for years’ experience (scaling awards). Employees can also be coerced into not discussing
					wages with their fellow employees which can lead to pay inequality even within the same organisation. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>When applying for a new job, for the same job at a competitor what is the expected Pay Rate? Over time rates?
						Penalty rates? Holiday or Leave entitlements? Parental leave? Are you being paid less than others with the
						same role at this organisation? </p>
					<p>This website allows you to answer all these questions and more from a user contributed database that is
						verified and pooled based on all others that have provided similar information. Then others can search based
						on their job description, location and employer size too see what everyone else paid in a similar role as well
						as other entitlements. </p>
					<p>An example of an existing product that does something similar would be PayScale.com a website that uses
						industry data to determine best priced contacts for employers, but our website is designed and focused on the
						employee. Other sites like Indeed.com.au and Seek.com.au can give you estimated pay scales for jobs in certain
						locations, but the pay scales they show have large variations and don’t include other entitlements. <br>
						The Australian government also does this, poorly. If you are paid against an award, congratulations you already
						have access to this information and you probably have a strong union behind it keeping this up to date. However,
						if a private agreement is used or you’re not part of a union, you could just be using the National Employment Standards,
						which are minimum at best and don’t explore pay rates above minimum wage.<br>
						If you want to see what the current going pay rate is for you role and location or you work in an industry that doesn’t
						have standard industry awards or publicly available enterprise agreements then this is the site for you.</p>
					<p>The main different between this site and competitors is that is user contributed, allowing for a much larger reach,
						resulting in bigger data sets that can give more accurate information. Of course, the user contributed data must be verified
						 - with using state of the art image processing and machine learning techniques, taking a photo of your pay stub from a phone
						 can be uploaded and verified against existing or similar entries.</p>
					<p>There is also a very global need for a site like this. This will give employees the ability to easily unionise or individually
						negotiate pays as all this information will be available to them. There are many countries that aren’t as lucky as Australia with
						our employment standards, and this website could close the income inequality that is increasing daily across the globe.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>FairPaid will be a website that will allow users to login for free, input their current job details, pay info and a snapshot of
						their pay slip to be added to the database, then allow them to search for similar jobs and see what the going pay rates are
						for them in their location (state or country) based on what others have contributed. Names and personal information won’t be
						included in the search results for privacy, purely averages for pay rates or listed rates as well as details for any
						entitlements (holiday days per year, etc). <br>
						The login will not remain free after a month, they can choose to pay a small monthly fee to continue access searches
						or pay to access searches of different jobs/ industries.</p>
					<p>A minimum viable product will consist of a base webapp with:<br>
						Secure User login, Detailed storage of someone’s Job Description, Industry, Employer information, Location (e.g. city)
						and a list of entitlements options (Holidays, Sick Days, Parental Leave Days, Allowances, etc). Photo storage of the
						employees paid stubs (allowing to blur out any personal details they don’t want to disclose such as bank details or TFNs)
						will be the key. Validation of this information will need to be done manually in the beginning. Having human verified data
						sets will be of higher quality and allow for better machine learning results for later versions.<br>
						Version 2 will have improved machine learning to better process images of pay slips to remove or significantly reduce the manual data verification. <br>
						It will also be used to find which large key jobs or industries are lacking user contribution so potential high traffic jobs
						can be targeted for promotion to fill these gaps.</p>
					<p>It will also require some data sets to exist for it to go ‘live’. If no one has contributed, then there will be no perceived benefit of the site.<br>
						Initial user generated content is key for this products success. This can be achieved by grassroots campaigning of the site
						initially with a small market pull on places like Reddit and collaborating with unions to help pre-fill some of the information.
						Targeting a key area and business type or specific large employer would be ideal especially if as population sizes for a
						large employer without unions would allow for larger data set.<br>
						Then promotion through a small social media campaign targeted at this specific location (Facebook/ Reddit), then followed up
						by a traditional media campaign of news stories for any success of a new or existing employee at the targeted business as part
						of an official launch. These success stories promoting the site will bring in more user contribution, resulting in more success
						stories and more user contribution and on and on.<br>
						Promoting globally from launch is mandatory, if there is going to be success it must hit as many areas as possible.</p>
					<p>How is FairPaid going to make money or sustain itself? FairPaid will follow a subscription-based model on a low dollar
						per month basis (i.e $5 a month) allows them to be able to search in a key industry for free for the month,
						additional industry searches are at an increased cost. User contributions will allow for a free months’ worth to promote
						users updating or adding new information for their industry. Then allow for them to cancel when they don’t need it
						(they got a job or no longer looking).<br>
						Other opportunities are available for advertising marketing from within the app. E.g. Cut a deal with leading Superannuation
						funds in specific industries, then promote those super funds when the user is contributing for that industry.
						Other promotion options could be available with banks, or payment services like Afterpay. <br>
						There will also be opportunities to collaborate with unions, allowing them a higher paid subscription to give broader
						searches to give them ammo when negotiating with employers.</p>

					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>The team will use Agile methodology, breaking the software development cycle into smaller chunks This enable the development
						team to compartmentalise and work to their strengths with small interactive tasks, while getting continuous feedback leading
						to a better working environment. </p>
					<p>Using a Domain Driven Design to link the product design to the core business concept will ensure the product can be transitioned
						to any other technology easily without any major disruption.  If a change in database engine, retirement of old technology occurs,
						the core design of the product using DDD lets it be easily transferred. It also benefits should a shift in technology be required
						due to expansion of the product that needs are not met with current technology.<br>
						It will also allow for quick and easy, sale or transfer of the product to another entity or rebrand and re-launch should it be needed.
						The code and design of the product will be easy to pick up and build upon should another team take over. Location of branding, product name,
						etc from within the product can be easily changed with this design and allow a fast turnaround should a re-launch be required.</p>
					<p>The web app will be managed, designed, and documented using Microsoft DevOps.
						Using Task Boards in DevOPs configured to the Agile methodology, sprints will be created and user stories outlining each piece of requirement.
						This will keep clear and concise requirements and allow scalability for team size.</p>
					<p>The communication between the team will be through Microsoft Teams, allowing for remote working environment in the current climate.
						It gives the team remote file storage, ability to run presentations internally and with stakeholders. And is future proof with the
						organisational growth connecting people between cities, states and even countries.</p>
					<p>The website will be built as a webapp using .NetCore 5 being written in C#. This is the most up to date cutting edge development option
						that is easy to develop with for any team members with different levels of experience.<br>
						It will be published to the web via Microsoft Azure. A Continuous Integration deployment plan will be designed and implemented using Microsoft DevOps to fulfill this.<br>
						This will allow for faster deployment of updates, assurance of quality of release with automated unite testing resulting in an overall streamlined development process.</p>
					<p>User login will use Microsoft Identity, allows for the user to authenticate with their existing Microsoft, Facebook or Google accounts.<br>
						It will meet high security requirements with Multi Factor Authentication due to the sensitivity of data that is stored.</p>
					<p>Data storage will initially use Azure DevOps SQL data as it is cost effective and will meet country security requirements. Data storage
						will be split across different countries to meet local regulations and allow for better performance of data access when it is localised.<br>
						The design of the product using DDD will allow for the data storage options to be changed should feasibility, cost or availability become an issue.</p>

					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>A team with the following skills sets will be required to complete the project:<br>
						Knowledge of C# and .NetCore development, although this can easily be picked up by any competent developer. <br>
						Experience with Agile methodologies will ensure fast and effective workflow. <br>
						Domain Experience in the employment industry or payroll industry for award interpretation with help greatly with planning on what is best to capture.<br>
					</p>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>Having extensive, verifiable pay information at your fingertips when taking a new job or requesting a
						pay increase will give power to employees for them to be paid closer to their true value.</p>
					<p>This can be achieved with a team by following Agile methodologies for quick, clear and iterative development
						and with the latest cutting-edge tools and technology from Microsoft, an industry leader.</p>
